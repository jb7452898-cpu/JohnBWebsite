# texas holdem notes

put a "Go Home" button on the player dashboard



If you want the CPUs to feel more “poker-like,” the next upgrades that make a big difference are:

Real side-pot handling (so uneven all-ins pay correctly)

Better AI: pot odds, position, and a little randomized bluffing

Bet sizing UI (quick buttons: 1/2 pot, pot, all-in) and hand history panel


created random names for the cpus

tie names to play styles

give certain names tells

or even keep a session history like “River Rat up +320 chips tonight”
more names:  el capitan
commodore
dragonslayer69
yo mama
linux_master
vic_20
Mr Coleco Vision
Trash_80
